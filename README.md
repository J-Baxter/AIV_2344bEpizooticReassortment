# The Winners Take It All? Evolutionary Success of H5Nx Reassortants in the 2020â€“2024 Panzootic

This repository contains code used for the data handling and statistical 
analysis of Clade 2.3.4.4b High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza Virus (HPAIV) 
circulating during the 2020-2024 Panzootic. Specifically, we analysed the emergence,
persistence and drivers of unique reassortants worldwide, up to May 2024. 

## Data Curation



## Statistical Models
We fitted three statistical models to quantify patterns of reassortant emergence
across continents and to understand the drivers of reassortant spatial diffusion. 
All models are located within the [statistical_models](scripts/statistical_models/) 
sub directory.\\

Briefly, the 'number of reassortants model' is a mixture model comprising a 
zero-inflated Poisson process and a binomial 'filter' process; the 'reassortant class model'
is an ordinal model, assuming a cumulative distribution; and the 'diffusion model' 
is a log-gamma regression. The
'number of reassortants model' was fitted using Stan via rStan, and the remainder were
fitted using BRMS. Each model has three associated scripts: one 
fitting the model, one to run model evaluations and one for interpretation. The
'number of reassortants model' has additional scripts to describe the model in Stan 
(located in [scripts/statistical_models/stan_models](scripts/statistical_models/stan_models))
and for pre-processing.

Evaluation and interpretation plots are produced in \*_model_evaluation and \*model_interpretation
scripts, however these may differ from the final published plots (located in
[scripts/figure_scripts](scripts/figure_scripts))

All models have been tested on i) Apple M4 Max 16-core CPU with 48 Gb RAM 
and AMD Ryzen 9 7950X 16 Core CPU with 96 Gb RAM.
