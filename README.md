# The Winners Take It All? Evolutionary Success of H5Nx Reassortants in the 2020â€“2024 Panzootic

This repository contains code used for the data handling and statistical 
analysis of Clade 2.3.4.4b High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza Virus (HPAIV) 
circulating during the 2020-2024 Panzootic. Specifically, we analysed the emergence,
persistence and drivers of unique reassortants worldwide, up to May 2024. 

## Data Curation

## Statistical Models
We fitted three statistical models to quantify patterns of reassortant emergence
across continents and to understand the drivers of reassortant spatial diffusion. 
All models are located within /scripts/statistical_models.
